# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more search filters to the UFO Sightings webpage in order to provide a more in-depth analysis for the users to search specific events. To do this I will utilize, Javascript and HTML coding with Visual Studio Code.

## Results
Using multiple filters, we can narrow down similar events in the same area. For example, by searching for the specific shape “light”, we see multiple results in the comments about people seeing 3 lights on January 1st, 2010, in California. Narrowing the search down further with those search filters and we can see that there are 5 different results of people in California reported seeing 3 bright red lights on the same night. Pretty interesting result! Thinking about a step further we may alter the code to include a “Key Words” search filter for the comments. That way someone could search for a specific event in order to find out if similar events have happened.
