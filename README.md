## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more search filters to the UFO Sightings webpage in order to provide a more in-depth analysis for the users to search specific events. To do this I will utilize, Javascript and HTML coding with Visual Studio Code.

## Results

Using the additional filters, we can narrow down similar events in the same area. For example, we can search by state now.

Or by shape.

And if we combine multiple search terms we can really get specific and discover some interesting similarities. For example by searching for the specific shape “light”, within the state of California, we see multiple results in the comments about people seeing 3 lights on January 1st, 2010.

Narrowing the search down further with those search filters and we can see that there are 5 different results of people in California reporting seeing 3 bright red lights on the same night. Pretty interesting result! 

## Summary
One drawback about the webpage is that currently we can not search for specific key words within the comments. That is why it is my recommendation that we add a "key words search filter to the group of filters. That way someone could search for a specific event in order to find out if similar events have happened near them. Also this is kind of a drawback for the data in general, but it would helpful if the time of the event were included as well.
